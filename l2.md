# Lesson 2

## 2.6 Step One: Define the Problem

* **Terminology**
  1. Clustering. Unsupervised learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.
  1. A categorical label has a discrete set of possible values, such as "is a cat" and "is not a cat."
  1. A continuous (regression) label does not have a discrete set of possible values, which means possibly an unlimited number of possibilities.
  1. Discrete: A term taken from statistics referring to an outcome taking on only a finite number of values (such as days of the week).
  1. A label refers to data that already contains the solution.
  1. Using unlabeled data means you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained.

  1. The AWS Machine Learning blog is a great resource for learning more about projects in machine learning.
  1. You can use Amazon SageMaker to calculate new stats in Major League Baseball.
  1. You can also find an article on Flagging suspicious healthcare claims with Amazon SageMaker on the AWS Machine Learning blog.
  1. What kinds of questions and problems are good for machine learning?
